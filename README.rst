Malicious Macro Bot Project
===========================

The main goals of this project are to:
* Provide a powerful malicious file triage tool for cyber responders.
* Help fill existing detection gaps for malicious office documents, which are still a very prevalent attack vector today.
* Deliver a new avenue for threat intelligence, a way to group similar malicious office documents together to identify phishing campaigns and track use of specific malicious document templates.

These goals are achieved through clever feature engineering and applied machine learning techniques like Random Forest and TF-IDF.
